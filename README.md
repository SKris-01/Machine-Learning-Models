# Machine-Learning-Models
This repository is designed to help developers, data scientists, and ML enthusiasts explore, learn, and implement various machine learning models with well-structured code and explanations.
The repository contains implementations of different machine learning algorithms using Python and popular ML libraries like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. The projects are designed to help learners understand fundamental ML concepts and build practical models.

**Type of ML Model**

(a) Supervised Learning Models – Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.

(b) Unsupervised Learning Models – K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), etc.

(c) Deep Learning Models – Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers (using TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch).

(d) Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc.

(e) Computer Vision – Image Classification, Object Detection, and Image Segmentation.

(f) Reinforcement Learning – Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), etc.

(g) End-to-End Projects – Real-world projects integrating ML models for practical applications.
